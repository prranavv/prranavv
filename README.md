## Hi my name is Pranav 😄

I'm a student and I have been coding for about 4 years !! I enjoy working on the backend and ever since I got my hands dirty using Go,it made me leave Node for good. I'm currently looking for a backend development role and I'd love to work for a start up!! If you are hiring,lets chat!!

- 👷 I primarily use golang but have experience in writing Python ,C ,C++ and JS.
- 🍀 I plan to learn Rust since I am a bit interested in the solana blockchain.
- 💬 You can contact me on my socials given on my profile!!
